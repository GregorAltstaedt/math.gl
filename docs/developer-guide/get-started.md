# Get Started

## Installation

If using a bundler like webpack to build your app with npm modules, use `npm` or `yarn` to install `@math.gl/core` and any other math.gl modules you need.

```
npm install @math.gl/core
```

## TypeScript

Type definitions are provided with each module. There is no need to install any separate types.

## ESM modules

Since v4.0, math.gl is published as ES modules, but with a CommonJS named export. This setup should work automatically for most applications and bundlers.
