## About Rotations

If you have a vector with 3 elements you can rotate it around an axis and a point like so:
```js
const v = new Vector3([1, 2, 3]).rotateZ({radians: ..., origin: [1, 1, 0]});

TBA:
* Show same operations with `Euler`, `Quaternion`, `Matrix4` methods.
* Show how to convert between them.
* Should be separate article or even blog post...
